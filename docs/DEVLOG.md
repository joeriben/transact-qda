# transact-qda Development Log

QDA platform grounded in Situational Analysis (Clarke) and transactional philosophy (Dewey/Bentley).
Core principle: the fundamental unit is the event (naming/relating act), not the entity.

## Session 00 — 2026-03-07

**Focus**: Project bootstrap and data model design

- Established transactional ontology: **namings**, **participations**, **appearances**
- Defined three-tier architecture:
  - Datenstruktur = ground truth (namings, appearances, designations, participations)
  - Liste = privileged representation (complete, dimensionless)
  - Canvas = derivative projection (convenient but epistemically subordinate)
- Set up SvelteKit 5 + PostgreSQL + Argon2id auth
- Deployed to transact.ucdcae.org via Cloudflare tunnel

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `d2a8fa1` | Initial scaffold: transact-qda |

---

## Session 01 — 2026-03-07

**Focus**: Transactional ontology implementation

- Renamed core tables from events/elements to **namings/participations/appearances**
- Implemented designation process: cue → characterization → specification
- Introduced **researcher-as-naming**: each user is a naming in the data space
- Every rename/designation creates transparency via memo + co-actor linking

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `0b56997` | Refactor to transactional ontology: namings, participations, appearances |
| `b1f8386` | Add designation process and researcher-as-naming |

---

## Session 02 — 2026-03-07

**Focus**: Situational Map as data-driven workflow

- Map as a naming that serves as a perspective
- Messy vs. Ordered: not modes, but aggregate designation states
- Phase emergence: phases as sub-perspectives
- Perspectival collapse: expressions appear differently from different perspectives
- Relation form with symmetry, valence, inscription
- Inscription history, inline rename, memo on designation change
- Naming act transparency: every analytical act gets a linkable memo

| Commit | Description |

---

## Session 03 — 2026-03-08

**Focus**: AI agent integration with ontological consistency

- AI as hybrid Naming: AI suggestions begin as Cues, researcher elevates via Accept/Reject
- Provider-agnostic AI client (OpenRouter primary, Anthropic fallback)
- Enabled meta-relations: relations can relate to other relations
- Perspectival collapse: a naming IS its stack, not its latest state
- Phases as embedded perspectives with auto-collapse on assignment
- Provenance indicators: empirical, analytical, or ungrounded
- Replaced emoji with Google Material Icons

## Session 07 — 2026-03-10

**Focus**: Canvas fixes, document annotation, infrastructure

- Fix canvas click-to-relate: left-click now completes relation as status bar promises
- Floating stack panel for canvas view (top-right overlay)
- Memo hover tooltips on canvas nodes (non-AI memos, pure CSS)
- Interactive document text annotation with CSS Custom Highlight API
- Nightly database backup via pg_dump + systemd timer (03:00, 30-day retention)

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `3298cfd` | Fix canvas: click-to-relate and floating stack panel |

---

## Session 08 — 2026-03-11

**Focus**: Image annotation, in-vivo coding, provenance design

- Image region annotation: rectangle selection with SVG overlay on normalized coordinates
- Image serving endpoint, ImageAnnotationViewer component with zoom/pan (reuses `createViewport()`)
- Unified sidebar: text selections and image regions share the same code picker panel
- In-vivo coding: create codes inline during annotation (type name → create + annotate in one step)
- Color picker for in-vivo codes, code uniqueness enforcement
- Zoom fixes: configurable min/max zoom in viewport, large image support, viewport constraint after zoom
- Text annotation rendering: segment-based inline color coding with hover tooltips (no layout shift)
- Monospace font for document text (Courier New/Consolas) — stable character positions for Gruppendiskussionen
- Fixed code panel: no longer scrolls away, stays in view while text scrolls independently
- **Design decision: provenance and codes** — documented in `docs/design-provenance-and-codes.md`
  - Codes should be a derived view from maps, not a separate ontological domain
  - Two orthogonal dimensions: CCS gradient (cue → characterization → specification) vs. grounding (📄 document anchor)
  - "There is no such thing as context" → all material (including discourse/theory texts) belongs in the corpus
  - Memos (📝) are reflexive process, not grounding. 📄 is the only grounding indicator.
  - AI visual analysis deferred — requires multimodal client, positioned as grounding assistant (not map-level co-analyst)

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `45b6f29` | Add image region annotation with rectangle selection and SVG overlay |
| `287d4c5` | Add in-vivo coding: create codes inline during annotation |
| `de0c481` | Add color picker for in-vivo codes, enforce code uniqueness |
| `ac39f27` | Fix image viewer zoom, cancel button, and large image support |
| `a550c06` | Segment-based text annotation rendering, monospace font, fixed code panel |

---

## Session 09 — 2026-03-11

**Focus**: Code system refactor — codes as derived view from maps

- **Retired `code-system` perspective** (ATLAS.ti model: codes as pre-existing categories)
- Renamed to `grounding-workspace`: infrastructure holding pen for orphan in-vivo codes, not a separate analytical domain
- **`getAnnotationCandidates()`** replaces `getCodeTree()`: pulls entities from ALL map perspectives + grounding workspace, `DISTINCT ON` preferring map appearances
- Annotation sidebar now groups candidates by source map (section headers)
- Color resolution perspective-agnostic (subquery across all entity appearances)
- Layout nav: "Codes" → "Grounding", badge shows grounded naming count
- **Grounding dashboard**: filter by grounded (📄) / ungrounded, grouped by source map
- Memo indicator (📝) shown as orthogonal marker — reflexive process, not a grounding category
- **Correction**: removed "reflected" as a grounding filter status — having a memo is CCS-gradient movement (cue→characterization), not grounding

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `71de965` | Refactor code system: codes as derived view from maps |

---

## Session 10 — 2026-03-12

**Focus**: Namings workspace and naming_acts unification

- Renamed Codes/Grounding sidebar to **Namings** — direct map links, standalone workspace
- Namings workspace: filter, create unplaced cues, relation proposition format
- **Unified `naming_acts`**: merged `naming_inscriptions` + `naming_designations` into single append-only stack
- Relation valence editing, mode switching, AI filter covers endpoints
- Canvas zoom fix: non-passive wheel listener, +/- zoom buttons

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ff059a6` | Fix grounding dashboard: remove reflected as grounding category |

---

## Session 13 — 2026-03-14

**Focus**: Multi-map architecture and structural integrity

- **Multi-map support**: place existing namings on multiple maps, cross-boundary signaling
- ELK layout resilience: skip orphaned edges, try/catch in initPositions
- Naming merge with confirmation step and auto-memo documenting absorbed naming
- Sidebar multi-map navigation
- **"Import from document"**: batch placement of document-grounded namings onto maps

## Session 14 — 2026-03-15

**Focus**: Social Worlds/Arenas Maps — epistemological foundations and initial rendering

- Epistemological deep dive into Clarke's SW/A maps (Session 14 transcript):
  - Social Worlds as universes of discourse (Strauss/Shibutani), not institutional containers
  - Arenas as dispositif configurations (Foucault), not neutral interaction zones
  - Resolved dual discourse question (Gasterstädt): Straussian and Foucauldian discourse must be held in productive tension
  - SW/A maps make stabilizations, conflict structures, and dispositival configurations visible
  - Discourses are constitutive forces, not mere elements
- **Formation classification via memo**: machine-readable `Formation: <role>` in first memo inscription — the analytical judgment "this IS a social world" is itself a naming act, not a structural type
- **Four formation roles** with distinct visual signatures per Clarke:
  - Social World: dotted ellipse
  - Arena: dashed ellipse (gestrichelt)
  - Organization: dashed rectangle
  - Discourse: solid ellipse, semi-transparent fill
- `addFormation` API action: creates element + classification memo with default size per role
- `getMapAppearances` extracts `sw_role` from first linked "Formation:" memo
- `FormationNode.svelte`: SVG component rendering inside existing `CanvasElement` (reuses drag/click logic)
- SW/A-specific add-form with role selector dropdown

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `f0fa562` | Add Social Worlds/Arenas map rendering with formation types |

---

## Session 14b — 2026-03-15

**Focus**: Interactive resize and rotation for SWA formation elements

- **Resize handles**: 4 cardinal handles (N/S/E/W) appear when a formation is selected; drag to change rx/ry
- **Rotation handle**: stem + circle above north edge; custom rotation cursor icon on hover/drag
- **Shift modifiers**: Shift+resize locks aspect ratio (proportional scaling); Shift+rotate snaps to 15° increments
- Rotation applied via SVG `<g transform="rotate(...)">` — no CSS transform conflicts
- Resize/rotate deltas corrected for viewport zoom and current rotation angle (2D rotation matrix)
- Generic `updateProperties` API action: merges arbitrary props into `appearances.properties` JSONB — reusable beyond formations
- **Svelte 5 event delegation workaround**: SVG handle events use native `addEventListener` via Svelte actions (`use:resizeHandle`, `use:rotateHandle`) + `stopImmediatePropagation` to prevent CanvasElement drag from intercepting handle interactions

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `e8fd4d9` | Add resize and rotation handles for SWA formation elements |
| `e38783c` | Fix handles: window-level listeners instead of SVG pointer capture |
| `ad8aa77` | Fix handles: Svelte actions with native listeners to bypass delegation |
| `c67e853` | Improve rotation handle: larger hit area and rotation cursor icon |
| `68a2390` | Add Shift+drag for proportional resize |

---

## Session 15 — 2026-03-16

**Focus**: SW/A map interaction polish, spatial relations, map duplication

- **Automatic spatial relation derivation** for SW/A maps: detects containment and overlap between formations based on position/size, syncs relations on drag/resize/rotate via `syncSpatialRelations`
- **Map duplication**: right-click context menu on maps listing page → "Duplicate". Creates new map with shared elements (same namings, new appearances with copied positions), cloned phases with memberships. Aligns with multi-map architecture — same naming, independent perspectival collapse
- **Withdraw/Restore in context menu**: all map types now offer withdraw/restore via right-click; FormationNode shows withdrawn state at 30% opacity
- Spatial/AI relations skip designation advance (`skipDesignationAdvance`) — provisional relations are not positive analytical acts
- Re-queue mechanism for spatial sync during concurrent drags
- Read-only map support and Clarke demo project restore
- **Bugfix**: relation node min-width increased (36px → 80px) to prevent single-character wrapping
- **Bugfix**: declined filter hint shows "hidden" instead of "showing"

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `5ad10c6` | Add automatic spatial relation derivation for SW/A maps |
| `be07a58` | Fix spatial sync: re-queue mechanism for concurrent drags |
| `e06448c` | Add withdraw/restore to context menu and withdrawn state on formations |
| `08f8301` | Add map duplication via context menu on maps listing page |
| `2165427` | Fix: spatial/AI relations must not advance endpoint designations |
| `9239229` | Fix declined filter hint: show 'hidden' instead of 'showing' |
| `98b01c8` | Fix relation node width: prevent single-char wrapping |
| `bfc055f` | Add read-only map support and restore Clarke demo project |

---

## Session 17 — 2026-03-16

**Focus**: Map page decomposition, type error fixes, displayMode restoration

- **Map page decomposition**: monolith `+page.svelte` (2881 lines) decomposed into 11 components + shared state factory (805 lines remaining)
  - `mapState.svelte.ts`: factory function with reactive getters/setters, distributed via `setContext`/`getContext`
  - Extracted: MapToolbar, StackPanel (unified floating+inline), ListItemCard, PhasesSidebar, NamingActPrompt, RelationForm, MemoPanel, ContextMenu, TopoPanel, OutsidePanel
  - StackPanel eliminates duplication between canvas floating panel and list inline panel
- **Type error fixes** (24 → 0): installed `@types/node` + `@types/pg`, typed query generics in codes/memos/namings queries, fixed role cast, pdf-parse import, layout param types
- **Dead CSS removal**: 20 unused selectors across 4 files
- **displayMode restoration**: discovered that the 3-way canvas display filter (Entities/Relations/Full) was silently dropped in commit `3deb477` (Session 15 WIP) — the feature had been implemented in `a5e9c66` but was replaced with a simpler `showConnections` toggle during a large rewrite. Restored from git history.

**Regression root cause**: Session 15 Claude rewrote the map page to add spatial containment + diamond shapes and silently replaced `displayMode` (3 modes: entities-only, relations-only, full+lines) with `showConnections` (binary toggle). No mention in session docs, no user confirmation. Prevention: pre-rewrite feature inventory rule added to memory.

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `afe270b` | Decompose map page monolith (2881→805 lines) + fix all type errors |
| `pending` | Restore displayMode 3-way canvas filter (Entities/Relations/Full) |

---

## Session 18 — 2026-03-17

**Focus**: Memo system Stages 3+4 — canvas integration & researcher memo enhancement

**Stage 3: Canvas Integration**
- **Memo count badge** on canvas nodes (amber pill in node-header) and FormationNode (SVG circle at top-right). Click opens stack panel.
- **AI memos included** in `memo_previews`: removed exclusion filter in `getMapAppearances()`, added `isAi` + `status` fields to JSON. AI memos with lifecycle status (presented/discussed) are now visible.
- **Improved tooltip**: min-width 280px, provenance badge (AI/R) per entry, status indicator, 150-char truncation, max 4 entries, "open stack" link at bottom.
- **List view memo count**: amber badge next to provenance icon in all three card types (entity, relation, silence). Ground-truth principle: list shows everything canvas shows.

**Stage 4: Researcher Memo Enhancement**
- **Map-context memo creation** via three entry points:
  - Right-click element → "Write memo" (linked to element)
  - Right-click empty canvas → "Write memo (this map)" (linked to map naming) or "Write free memo" (unlinked)
  - Toolbar button rejected after user feedback: "Memo" is a different logical level than Layout/Topo/AI operations
- **MemoCreateForm.svelte**: floating form with title, textarea, linked-element chips, backdrop dismiss
- **Memo-to-memo linking** in StackPanel: "link" button per memo → search dropdown → creates participation between two memos (analytical threads)

**Design decision**: No toolbar memo button. Memo creation is always contextual (right-click on element or empty canvas), never a toolbar-level operation. The toolbar is for map operations; memos are analytical actions.

**Files**: `maps.ts` (query), `+page.svelte` (badges + tooltip + canvas ctx menu), `FormationNode.svelte` (SVG badge), `ListItemCard.svelte` (list badge), `InfiniteCanvas.svelte` (context menu callback), `mapState.svelte.ts` (state + actions), `MemoCreateForm.svelte` (new), `ContextMenu.svelte` ("Write memo"), `StackPanel.svelte` (memo-to-memo link)

---

## Design Decision — 2026-03-17: SQLite-per-project rejected

**Evaluated**: One SQLite file per project for data portability (export = copy file, import = place file, sharing = send one file).

**Rejected because**: SQLite's write-locking model does not support concurrent multiuser access or parallel AI agent operations. A single writer lock blocks all other writes — incompatible with the architecture where researcher and AI agent write simultaneously.

**Consequence**: PostgreSQL remains the database. Data portability will be achieved via **QDPX (QDA-XML, ISO standard)** import/export instead (see Issue #5).

---

## Bugfixes — 2026-03-15

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `4c33c74` | Fix phase assignment in canvas mode: clicking nodes now assigns to active phase |
