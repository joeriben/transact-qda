# transact-qda Development Log

QDA platform grounded in Situational Analysis (Clarke) and transactional philosophy (Dewey/Bentley).
Core principle: the fundamental unit is the event (naming/relating act), not the entity.

## Session 00 — 2026-03-07

**Focus**: Project bootstrap and data model design

- Established transactional ontology: **namings**, **participations**, **appearances**
- Defined three-tier architecture:
  - Datenstruktur = ground truth (namings, appearances, designations, participations)
  - Liste = privileged representation (complete, dimensionless)
  - Canvas = derivative projection (convenient but epistemically subordinate)
- Set up SvelteKit 5 + PostgreSQL + Argon2id auth
- Deployed to transact.ucdcae.org via Cloudflare tunnel

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `d2a8fa1` | Initial scaffold: transact-qda |

## Session 01 — 2026-03-07

**Focus**: Transactional ontology implementation

- Renamed core tables from events/elements to **namings/participations/appearances**
- Implemented designation process: cue → characterization → specification
- Introduced **researcher-as-naming**: each user is a naming in the data space
- Every rename/designation creates transparency via memo + co-actor linking

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `0b56997` | Refactor to transactional ontology: namings, participations, appearances |
| `b1f8386` | Add designation process and researcher-as-naming |

## Session 02 — 2026-03-07

**Focus**: Situational Map as data-driven workflow

- Map as a naming that serves as a perspective
- Messy vs. Ordered: not modes, but aggregate designation states
- Phase emergence: phases as sub-perspectives
- Perspectival collapse: expressions appear differently from different perspectives
- Relation form with symmetry, valence, inscription
- Inscription history, inline rename, memo on designation change
- Naming act transparency: every analytical act gets a linkable memo

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `b239c6f` | Situational map: data-driven workflow with designation gradient |

| `072ce39` | Naming act transparency: every rename/designation creates a linkable memo |
| `f0ec7bb` | Fix invalid date in memos list: use created_at instead of updated_at |

## Session 03 — 2026-03-08

**Focus**: AI agent integration with ontological consistency

- AI as hybrid Naming: AI suggestions begin as Cues, researcher elevates via Accept/Reject
- Provider-agnostic AI client (OpenRouter primary, Anthropic fallback)
- Enabled meta-relations: relations can relate to other relations
- Perspectival collapse: a naming IS its stack, not its latest state
- Phases as embedded perspectives with auto-collapse on assignment
- Provenance indicators: empirical, analytical, or ungrounded
- Replaced emoji with Google Material Icons

- Fix canvas click-to-relate: left-click now completes relation as status bar promises
- Floating stack panel for canvas view (top-right overlay)
- Memo hover tooltips on canvas nodes (non-AI memos, pure CSS)
- Interactive document text annotation with CSS Custom Highlight API
- Nightly database backup via pg_dump + systemd timer (03:00, 30-day retention)

| Commit | Description |

## Session 08 — 2026-03-11

**Focus**: Image annotation, in-vivo coding, provenance design

- Image region annotation: rectangle selection with SVG overlay on normalized coordinates
- Image serving endpoint, ImageAnnotationViewer component with zoom/pan (reuses `createViewport()`)
- Unified sidebar: text selections and image regions share the same code picker panel
- In-vivo coding: create codes inline during annotation (type name → create + annotate in one step)
- Color picker for in-vivo codes, code uniqueness enforcement
- Zoom fixes: configurable min/max zoom in viewport, large image support, viewport constraint after zoom
- Text annotation rendering: segment-based inline color coding with hover tooltips (no layout shift)
- Monospace font for document text (Courier New/Consolas) — stable character positions for Gruppendiskussionen
- Fixed code panel: no longer scrolls away, stays in view while text scrolls independently
- **Design decision: provenance and codes** — documented in `docs/design-provenance-and-codes.md`
  - Codes should be a derived view from maps, not a separate ontological domain
  - Two orthogonal dimensions: CCS gradient (cue → characterization → specification) vs. grounding (📄 document anchor)
  - "There is no such thing as context" → all material (including discourse/theory texts) belongs in the corpus
  - Memos (📝) are reflexive process, not grounding. 📄 is the only grounding indicator.
  - AI visual analysis deferred — requires multimodal client, positioned as grounding assistant (not map-level co-analyst)

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `45b6f29` | Add image region annotation with rectangle selection and SVG overlay |
| `287d4c5` | Add in-vivo coding: create codes inline during annotation |

| `ac39f27` | Fix image viewer zoom, cancel button, and large image support |
| `a550c06` | Segment-based text annotation rendering, monospace font, fixed code panel |

## Session 09 — 2026-03-11

**Focus**: Code system refactor — codes as derived view from maps

- **Retired `code-system` perspective** (ATLAS.ti model: codes as pre-existing categories)
- Renamed to `grounding-workspace`: infrastructure holding pen for orphan in-vivo codes, not a separate analytical domain
- **`getAnnotationCandidates()`** replaces `getCodeTree()`: pulls entities from ALL map perspectives + grounding workspace, `DISTINCT ON` preferring map appearances
- Annotation sidebar now groups candidates by source map (section headers)
- Color resolution perspective-agnostic (subquery across all entity appearances)
- Layout nav: "Codes" → "Grounding", badge shows grounded naming count
- **Grounding dashboard**: filter by grounded (📄) / ungrounded, grouped by source map
- Memo indicator (📝) shown as orthogonal marker — reflexive process, not a grounding category
- **Correction**: removed "reflected" as a grounding filter status — having a memo is CCS-gradient movement (cue→characterization), not grounding

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `71de965` | Refactor code system: codes as derived view from maps |

- **Unified `naming_acts`**: merged `naming_inscriptions` + `naming_designations` into single append-only stack
- Relation valence editing, mode switching, AI filter covers endpoints
- Canvas zoom fix: non-passive wheel listener, +/- zoom buttons

## Session 14 — 2026-03-15

**Focus**: Social Worlds/Arenas Maps — epistemological foundations and initial rendering

- Epistemological deep dive into Clarke's SW/A maps (Session 14 transcript):
  - Social Worlds as universes of discourse (Strauss/Shibutani), not institutional containers
  - Arenas as dispositif configurations (Foucault), not neutral interaction zones
  - Resolved dual discourse question (Gasterstädt): Straussian and Foucauldian discourse must be held in productive tension
  - SW/A maps make stabilizations, conflict structures, and dispositival configurations visible
  - Discourses are constitutive forces, not mere elements
- **Formation classification via memo**: machine-readable `Formation: <role>` in first memo inscription — the analytical judgment "this IS a social world" is itself a naming act, not a structural type
- **Four formation roles** with distinct visual signatures per Clarke:
  - Social World: dotted ellipse
  - Arena: dashed ellipse (gestrichelt)
  - Organization: dashed rectangle
  - Discourse: solid ellipse, semi-transparent fill
- `addFormation` API action: creates element + classification memo with default size per role
- `getMapAppearances` extracts `sw_role` from first linked "Formation:" memo
- `FormationNode.svelte`: SVG component rendering inside existing `CanvasElement` (reuses drag/click logic)
- SW/A-specific add-form with role selector dropdown

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `f0fa562` | Add Social Worlds/Arenas map rendering with formation types |
